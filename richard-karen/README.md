# 02-jqurey-and-the-dom

Authors: Karen Perez and Richard Montgomery
Version: 1.0.0

Overview:
It's a Lorem Ipsum Blog full of Lorem Ipsums with jQuery syntax that sorts blog articles by date.

Getting Started:
Fork, clone, code. Almost the entire content was provided us. We built code around existing code that allowed us to produce article objects, sort them by date, and append them to the HTML.

Architecture:
We added in script using jquery methods. The outline of the project was to traverse the HTML and set items to the page.
